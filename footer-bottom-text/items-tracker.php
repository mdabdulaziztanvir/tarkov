    <p>Knowing what items, you will need through your progression and journey in Tarkov, is crucial!</p>
    <p>One important tool for players is a quest items tracker reference page.</p>
    <p>A quest item tracker reference page is a guide that provides detailed information on different types of items a player will need when unlocking quest during his progression and leveling journey.</p>
    <p>This information typically includes the name of the items, their picture, or the way it looks, which trader will need the item later in the game and, the knowledge if an item can be crafted or doesn’t need to have the ‘’found in raid’’ status.</p>
    <p>The information on a quest item tracker reference page can be used by players to help them make informed decisions about which items they need to extract from a raid, to use, to sell or to keep for giving it to a trader in a later quest.</p>
    <p>For example, some items may be rare and hard to find during the players playtime. By knowing the value in importance, during a raid, of a looted item, players can make an easiest decision about if an item need to be kept or if they need to extract quickly to have the ‘’found in raid’’ status on the item. Players can, in this case, change their playstyle in function of their decisions.</p>
    <p>The reference page should also include information about the specific number of times, items need to be found. This is an important detail players need to know to complete their quests.</p>
    <p>In addition to its practical use, a quest items tracker reference page can also be a valuable tool for players who are interested in the lore, universe, story and realism of the game. It helps to understand the in-game's world items and makes the game experience more complete and immersive.</p>
    <p>In summary, a quest items tracker reference page is an essential tool for Escape from Tarkov players.</p>
    <p>It provides detailed information on the number of items players need to complete their quest faster, be able to progress quickly and makes good decisions for their future experience.</p>
    <p>With the right information, players can decrease the time needed to find an item, completing a quest from a vendor and have a much less frustrating experience in the realistic world of Tarkov.</p>
