    <p>In the game Escape from Tarkov, the Interchange map is the most recognize map because of its big mall. </p>
    <p>A map quest tracker reference map is also needed for players because the mall has 3 huge floors with a lot of stores that players can complete their quest.</p>
    <p>With its boss Killa, the most hated boss in the game, the map is played by a lot of players from Escape of Tarkov</p>
    <p> With that map item tracker reference page, players will know where the boss will spawn and have less complication to be able to complete their quest.</p>
